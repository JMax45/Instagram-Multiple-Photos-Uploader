# Instagram-Multiple-Photos-Uploader

IMPU is a Python script for uploading multiple photos in Instagram.
It's impossible to do with the official apps but this script will help.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install instapy-cli.

```bash
pip install instapy-cli
```
Then download this repository.
## Usage
On line 7 and 8 in main.py put your Instagram login and password.
```python
#login
username = 'username'
password = 'password'
```
Then copy the photos you want to upload in the folder *files_to_upload* and start the script.
You can delete *test.png* from *files_to_upload*.
